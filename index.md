Hi, stranger

Welcome to my small blog. I have a practice of writing and teaching myself research papers and artificial intelligence concepts both for my study and work. I find it interesting. That's why, I randomly take a paper that consider to be impactful and write a thorough study that is helpful to both beginners and experts alike. 

I have written in the past but past few years, writing platforms were poor in quality. Popular alternatives like Medium and Substack are good but I don't like their over-bloated user-interface. Including their platform incentive to make everything paid. I consider learning should be free and open to everyone and writer should generally earn from the constructive criticisms rather direct monetary incentives. Regardless, I have chosen to take the route to having my own writing on my personal blog. 

I write quite frequently, if you follow-along and into Deep Learning research and Artificial Intelligence in general it might be helpful for you.
